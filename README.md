# Pisco

Pisco is a keyboard only controller for Sonos speakers.
While Pisco's graphical interface displays the album art of the currently running track,
you can control playback with your keyboard.

Pisco has been tested on Linux and on macOS.
It is particularly well-suited for usage with
small displays (e.g. [Pimoroni HyperPixel 4.0 Square](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hyperpixel-4-square?variant=30138251477075)) and
media remotes (e.g. [Satechi Bluetooth Multi-Media Remote](https://satechi.net/products/satechi-bluetooth-multi-media-remote?variant=27129644617)).


## Setup

1. Make sure you are using Python 3.7 or newer.
2. Create a virtual environment if you do not want to clutter up your default environment.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Install dependencies:
    ```shell
    pip3 install --requirement requirements.txt
    ```


## Usage

When starting Pisco,
you need to provide the name of the Sonos device (i.e. Sonos room) you want to control:

```shell
./pisco.py Leseecke # Replace 'Leseecke' by the name of your Sonos device.
```

You can use the option `--help` to find additional options:
```text
$ ./pisco.py --help

  Control your Sonos device with your keyboard

  -b, --backlight DIRECTORY    sysfs directory of the backlight that should be
                               deactivated when the device is not playing
